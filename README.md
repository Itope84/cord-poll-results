# Poll Results

In this folder, you'll find some resources for implementing a simple poll
results UI. Please use them as a specification for implementation. These
are just examples/helpers that should give you a sense of the desired UI.

With these resources, please create a small project that implements a working
version of the mocked UI.

## What should you build

You may use a single HTML file and raw CSS/JS or you can use tools like
create-react-app, whatever you prefer. Remember, we're looking at your code â€”
use NPM packages very sparingly. This doesn't need to be a carefully factored
UI library. We're interested in your overall code quality, clarity, simplicity,
and correctness. We don't need this to be a production-ready, professional grade
UI with test coverage and rich documentation. Be pragmatic and, most importantly,
don't spend hours on this. Two to three hours is more than enough time to
create something workable.

## What should you do when you finish?

Please send us either a ZIP file, filesharing link, or a GitHub link with your
work. If you create a full-on JS application please do not includes the
node_modules folder.
